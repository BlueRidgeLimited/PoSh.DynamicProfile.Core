# PoSh.DynamicProfile.Core
PoSh.DynamicProfile.Core is a simple, yet  both versatile &amp; extensible Configuration System/Framework for PowerShell, designed and written primarily with Profile Scripts in mind. Of course, the focus on Profiles merely serves as both a proof of concept, as well as a singular foundation used to construct the main pillars, rules, and heart of the greater overall Framework. By Default, this Module leverages PowerShell Data Files (*.psd1 file extension), known mainly for the role they play as Module Manifests, as the format which Configuration files are written in, and therefore, the formatting of these Config. files will be structured around PowerShell syntax, and the capabilities of *.psd1 files. However, other formats, namely JSON/JSONC, and possibly XML are being considered, and if you have a favored format you'd like to see implimented, or believe would serve the job better, feel free to open an issue, send requests to my email, or even create your own implimentation and contribute!
